                    Stocks, shares or equity are a type of security that signifies a fractional ownership of a particular company or corporation. Most stocks are publicly listed on exchanges such as the

                    <br><br>
                    Similar to stock, options may be traded via public exchanges or they can be transacted

                    Some common option types are the call option (buy) and the put option (sell). There also exist a myriad of options strategies, some examples include

                    The options contract can be targeted against a bunch of underlying assets, including but not limited to equity options, bond options, future options, index options and many others.

                    Due to their inherit volatility and more complex nature, it carries a lot higher risk than standard stock trading. It should only be executed by seasoned experts.

                    Similar to the above options, futures are also a type of financial derivative. However, one striking difference is that the buying or selling of the underlying asset is obligated to be performed at a specific future date and price unlike options.
                    <br><br>
                    They are normally traded using futures exchanges such as

                    It can also be traded OTC.
                    <br><br>
                    Since these are highly leverage products (i.e. the trader does not need to fork up the full amount upfront, but insteads uses borrowed money, allowing higher leverage of one's liquid assets), it involves high risk.

                    <br><br>
                    They can be purchased and sold similar to that of stocks. Some ubiquitous ETFs include

                    CFDs also know as contract for difference are an agreement between two parties that they will cash-settle the difference between prices now and the stipulated time in the future. Whatever profit one side makes will be handed over by the losing end.
                    <br><br>
                    Since the both parties in the CFD contract do not actually own the underlying asset they can gain exposure to the risk and rewards of the asset without owning it. CFDs also typically allow for higher margin as compared to other alternatives.

                    Similar to the above few instruments, CFDs are also extremely risky and are only suitable for experts.

                    Planning of trades before making them and following said plan during the full execution is very important. Especially for beginners, the emotions of losing money can cause rushed entries and exits from the market leading to realized losses.
                    <br><br>
                    Properly set and adhere to your stop loss and take profit levels. Being greedy once the trade turned in your favour is how many turn a winning trade is a losing one.
                    <br><br>
                    Diversity in market exposure is paramount to reduce the impact of your portfolio should one sector underperform.
